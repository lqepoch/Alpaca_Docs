# Tokenization Guide for Issuer

Instant Tokenization Network (ITN) is a platform designed to streamline and accelerate the process of in-kind mint and redemption of tokenized assets. The goal of ITN is to enable efficient, secure, and rapid conversion of real-world and digital assets to and from various tokens issued by partners on the network. The network acts as instant settlement rails for market participants to programmatically rebalance inventory, thereby stitching together fragmented tokenized asset liquidity across the industry. This document will guide the **Issuer** of tokenized assets on how to start using Alpaca’s Instant Tokenization Network.

# Overview

Before you start integrating into Alpaca's ITN (Instant Tokenization Network) as an issuer of tokenized assets, you would need to:

* Complete your integration into Alpaca's Broker API offering.
* Have an account in your name at Alpaca.

If you have not done so yet, please make sure to reach out to Alpaca sales to initiate the conversation.

If you have already done so, the below document will guide you to integrate into ITN. This will be achieved by:

* Implementing 4 endpoints on your platform that Alpaca will utilize to process account linking & token minting.
  * [Account Linking](https://docs.alpaca.markets/docs/tokenization-guide-for-issuer#issuers-account-linking-endpoint)
  * [Tokenized Assets](https://docs.alpaca.markets/docs/tokenization-guide-for-issuer#tokenized-assets-data)
  * [Mint Request](https://docs.alpaca.markets/docs/tokenization-guide-for-issuer#issuers-mint-request-endpoint)
  * [Mint Confirmation](https://docs.alpaca.markets/docs/tokenization-guide-for-issuer#issuer-mint-transfer-confirmation-endpoint)
* Integrating with 2 Alpaca endpoints that you will utilize to complete token minting and redemption flows.
  * [Mint Confirmation Callback](https://docs.alpaca.markets/docs/tokenization-guide-for-issuer#alpacas-mint-confirmation-callback-endpoint)
  * [Redeem Request](https://docs.alpaca.markets/docs/tokenization-guide-for-issuer#alpacas-redeem-request-endpoint)

## Important Prerequisite

During the mint and redeem process, Instant Tokenization Network will transfer securities between the AP's Alpaca account and the Issuer's Alpaca account. If you, as an issuer, hold multiple accounts at Alpaca, please ensure to inform Alpaca which of your accounts should be designated for tokenization.

# Authentication

All endpoints that you implement and expose to Alpaca (account linking, tokenized assets data, mint request, mint transfer confirmation) must authenticate the caller. Alpaca supports two schemes, chosen per-Issuer at onboarding and used uniformly across all four endpoints:

1. **API key** *(default)* — a shared secret you supply to Alpaca; Alpaca sends it on every request in the `X-API-KEY` header.
2. **HTTP Message Signatures (Ed25519)** — Alpaca signs every outbound request with an Ed25519 private key under [RFC 9421](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9421); you verify with the public key Alpaca shares at onboarding. Body integrity uses [RFC 9530 `Content-Digest`](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9530).

You only need to implement the scheme that was agreed during onboarding. In both cases, your endpoints should respond `401 Unauthorized` to any request that fails authentication or is missing the required headers.

## Option 1: API key (default)

During onboarding you share a secret API key with Alpaca. Alpaca includes it on every outbound request in the following HTTP header:

```html
X-API-KEY: <your-issuer-api-key>
```

The same key is used for all four Issuer-implemented endpoints.

## Option 2: HTTP Message Signatures (Ed25519)

Alpaca signs every outbound request with an Ed25519 keypair under [RFC 9421 (HTTP Message Signatures)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9421). Body integrity uses [RFC 9530 (`Content-Digest`)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9530).

### Key exchange at onboarding

Alpaca generates the Ed25519 keypair and shares **only the public key** with you. You will receive two pieces of information:

| Item       | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
| :--------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Public key | PEM-encoded Ed25519 public key (single `BEGIN PUBLIC KEY` / `END PUBLIC KEY` block).                                                                                  |
| `keyid`    | An opaque string Alpaca uses to identify which key signed a given request (e.g. `alpaca-issuer-2026-01`). The same `keyid` appears in every `Signature-Input` header. |

The private key never leaves Alpaca's environment.

### Headers Alpaca sets on every signed request

For requests **with** a body (all four `POST` endpoints):

```http
POST /tokenization/mint HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Digest: sha-256=:<base64(sha256(raw-body))>:
Signature-Input: sig=("@method" "@target-uri" "content-type" "content-digest");created=<unix-seconds>;keyid="<keyid>";alg="ed25519";nonce="<128-bit random hex>"
Signature: sig=:<base64(ed25519-signature-bytes)>:
```

For **bodyless** requests (the `GET /tokenization/tokens` endpoint):

```http
GET /tokenization/tokens HTTP/1.1
Signature-Input: sig=("@method" "@target-uri");created=<unix-seconds>;keyid="<keyid>";alg="ed25519";nonce="<128-bit random hex>"
Signature: sig=:<base64(ed25519-signature-bytes)>:
```

Notes on what Alpaca emits:

* The signature label is always `sig`. One signature per request.
* For bodyless requests, Alpaca neither sets `Content-Type` / `Content-Digest` nor includes them in the signature base; the covered components are only `("@method" "@target-uri")`.
* `created` is the request's Unix timestamp in seconds.
* `nonce` is fresh 128-bit random entropy per request, hex-encoded.

### Worked example

A `POST /tokenization/mint` request signed with `keyid="alpaca-issuer-2026-01"` produces headers of this shape:

```http
POST /tokenization/mint HTTP/1.1
Host: issuer.example.com
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Digest: sha-256=:X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=:
Signature-Input: sig=("@method" "@target-uri" "content-type" "content-digest");created=1700000000;keyid="alpaca-issuer-2026-01";alg="ed25519";nonce="deadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeef"
Signature: sig=:lD6c6jHb6kQTzZ5pK6m7Bt2u8m1bF1mE4qLh3i2cIuv6xv1uYwK1Kx4G2k8nC0z3pE5p9c4r4cZ8aFwq9XnZAg==:

{"tokenization_request_id":"12345-678-90AB", ...}
```

### Key rotation

Alpaca may rotate its signing key periodically. Alpaca shares the new public key and new `keyid` with you ahead of an agreed cut-over time. At the cut-over time, Alpaca switches to signing with the new key, and from that moment every request's `Signature-Input` header carries the new `keyid`.

# Quantity Precision

Alpaca accepts up to **9 decimal places** for underlying securities quantities. This limit applies to both the mint and redeem flows:

* **Mint**: Alpaca will never ask you to mint more than 9 decimal places of an underlying security. Any AP mint request with a `qty` exceeding 9 decimals is rejected by Alpaca before it reaches your platform.
* **Redeem**: When you submit a redeem request to Alpaca, the `qty` (quantity of the underlying security to transfer back to the AP) must have at most 9 decimal places. Redeem requests with higher precision will be rejected.

# Handshake Process

Before an entity can mint or redeem your tokenized assets through ITN, they will need to reach out to Alpaca’s operation team for a "handshake" step through which Alpaca will need to verify that the entity is:

* An existing client of Alpaca.
* An existing client of your firm and registered as an authorized participant (AP) on your platform.

To automate this process, you will need to provide an account linking endpoint that Alpaca can utilize to link an AP’s account at Alpaca to their account on your platform. Alpaca will maintain this linking and use it during the mint and redeem processes.

#### Issuer’s Account Linking Endpoint

Alpaca will invoke your account linking endpoint by providing the AP's email and their Alpaca account number. Your endpoint should respond with the AP’s account number on your platform that Alpaca will store for future use during the mint and redeem flow:

**Expected Request**

**Endpoint**

```html
POST /tokenization/accounts/connect
```

**Body**

```json
{
  "email": "customer@firm.com",
  "client_account_number": "alpaca_account_number"
}
```

| Field                   | Description                              |
| :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| email                   | AP’s email used on the Issuer’s platform |
| client\_account\_number | AP's Alpaca account number.              |

**Expected Response**

**Body**

```json
{
  "client_external_account_id": "5505-1234-ABC-4G45"
}
```

| Field                         | Description                                       |
| :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| client\_external\_account\_id | AP’s account identifier on the Issuer’s platform. |

**Status Codes**

| Status | Description            |
| :----- | :--------------------- |
| 200    | OK - Successful link   |
| 404    | Email not found        |
| 409    | Account already linked |

# Tokenized Assets Data

You will need to provide Alpaca an endpoint that can be used to retrieve the list of supported tokenized assets on your issuer platform. The endpoint should provide the following data:

* underlying symbol
* token symbol
* supported blockchain networks

**Expected Request**

**Endpoint**

```html
GET /tokenization/tokens
```

**Expected Response**

**Body**

```json
{
  "tokens": [
    {
	"underlying": "AAPL",
	"token": "tAAPL",	
	"networks": ["solana", "ethereum"]
    },
    {
	"underlying": "TSLA",
  	"token": "tTSLA",
	"networks": ["solana", "ethereum"]
   }
  ]
}
```

| Field      | Description                |
| :--------- | :------------------------- |
| tokens     | List of supported tokens   |
| underlying | Underlying asset symbol    |
| token      | Token asset symbol         |
| networks   | List of supported networks |

Alpaca will use this information when validating an AP's mint request.

# Dynamic Custody Accounts

If you hold different underlying assets in different Alpaca accounts, you will need to provide Alpaca a dynamic custody account endpoint. Alpaca will use this endpoint to identify which of your Alpaca accounts custodies an underlying asset while processing a mint request.

The URL that you provide must include the `{underlying_symbol}` placeholder in the path:

```html
https://issuer.example.com/tokenization/custody-accounts/{underlying_symbol}
```

Alpaca will replace `{underlying_symbol}` with the underlying asset symbol when invoking your endpoint.

**Expected Request**

**Endpoint**

```html
GET /tokenization/custody-accounts/{underlying_symbol}
```

For example, when resolving the custody account for `AAPL`, Alpaca will invoke:

```html
GET /tokenization/custody-accounts/AAPL
```

**Expected Response**

**Body**

```json
{
  "account_id": "7d56753c-ecfa-4077-8e05-64fae3d2f3b0",
  "underlying_symbol": "AAPL"
}
```

| Field              | Description                                                                                              |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| account\_id        | UUID of the Issuer’s Alpaca account that custodies the underlying asset                                  |
| underlying\_symbol | Underlying asset symbol requested by Alpaca. This value must exactly match the symbol in the request URL |

Your endpoint must resolve every underlying symbol returned by your tokenized assets endpoint. Alpaca will only invoke the custody account endpoint for symbols included in your supported tokenized asset list.

If Alpaca cannot resolve a valid custody account, the mint request will not proceed.

> 📘 **Custody account caching**
>
> Alpaca caches each successful custody account resolution for 24 hours. If an underlying asset moves to another custody account, Alpaca may continue using the previous account until the cached resolution expires.

# Mint Endpoint and Workflow

The token minting flow has multiple steps that begin when an AP requests token minting from Alpaca. The steps are explained below & depicted in Figure 1 to help you visualize, and all endpoints mentioned are documented below as well.

1. The Authorized Participant sends Alpaca a mint request.
2. Alpaca invokes [an endpoint on your platform to submit a mint request](https://docs.alpaca.markets/docs/tokenization-guide-for-issuer#issuers-mint-request-endpoint), with a JSON object in the body. Your platform will need to validate the mint request.
3. Alpaca transfers the underlying security from the AP’s account into your Alpaca account.
4. Alpaca invokes [another endpoint on your platform to confirm the underlying asset's transfer status](https://docs.alpaca.markets/docs/tokenization-guide-for-issuer#issuer-mint-transfer-confirmation-endpoint).
5. Your platform deposits the tokens into the AP’s wallet on a successful transfer.
6. Your platform invokes [Alpaca’s endpoint to confirm the successful token mint](https://docs.alpaca.markets/docs/tokenization-guide-for-issuer#alpacas-mint-confirmation-callback-endpoint), providing the designated Alpaca tokenization account\_id as a URL parameter in the endpoint.

}
```

> 📘 **AP identifier**
>
> Alpaca will send exactly one of `client_external_account_id` or `client_account_id` to identify the Authorized Participant. Which one is used for a given AP/Issuer pair is fixed by agreement between the Issuer and Alpaca (typically `client_external_account_id` when the AP and Issuer are linked via the handshake flow, and `client_account_id` when the AP's correspondent is authorized by the Issuer directly).

>
> Alpaca retries the confirmation when it receives a 5xx response, and when the connection fails or times out before a response arrives. Every attempt carries an identical body. A retry can therefore reach you after you have already processed an earlier attempt whose response Alpaca never received.
>
> Treat `tokenization_request_id` as an idempotency key: repeated deliveries carrying the same `tokenization_request_id` must mint at most once, and must return the same result as the first delivery. A 4xx response is treated as a permanent rejection and is not retried.

# Redeem Endpoint and Workflow

The token redeem flow has multiple steps that begin when an AP deposits token into a redemption wallet address that you provide them with. The steps are explained below & depicted in Figure 2 to help you visualize, and all endpoints mentioned are documented below as well.

1. The token redemption process will be initiated by an end client by moving tokens into a redemption wallet address provided by you as an Issuer, at which point these tokens should be removed from circulation.
2. Your platform should then notify Alpaca that an AP has redeemed their tokens by invoking [an endpoint](https://docs.alpaca.markets/docs/tokenization-guide-for-issuer#alpacas-redeem-request-endpoint). Your platform should provide their designated Alpaca tokenization account\_id as a URL parameter in the endpoint.
3. Alpaca will transfer the underlying asset from your Alpaca account as an issuer, into the AP’s Alpaca account.

## Endpoint you need to integrate with

#### Alpaca's Redeem Request Endpoint

This endpoint will be invoked by your platform at step 2. For more details, check full [API reference](https://docs.alpaca.markets/reference/posttokenizationredeem).

**Request**

**Endpoint**

```html
POST /v1/accounts/:account_id/tokenization/callback/redeem
```

**Body**

```json
{
  "issuer_request_id": "ABC-123-DEF-456",
  "underlying_symbol": "AAPL",
  "token_symbol": "AAPLx",
  "client_external_account_id": "5505-1234-ABC-4G45",
  "qty": "1.23",
  "network": "solana",
  "wallet_address": "<the originating wallet address for the redeemed tokens>",
  "tx_hash": "0x12345678"
}
```

> 📘 **AP identifier**
>
> Exactly one of `client_external_account_id` or `client_account_id` must be provided in the body to identify the Authorized Participant. Which one is used for a given AP/Issuer pair is fixed by agreement between the Issuer and Alpaca (typically `client_external_account_id` when the AP and Issuer are linked via the handshake flow, and `client_account_id` when the AP's correspondent is authorized by the Issuer directly).

**Idempotency**

Each redeem request must carry a unique `issuer_request_id` that you assign. Alpaca uses it as the redeem idempotency key: an `issuer_request_id` may be used only once, so reusing a value Alpaca has already seen is rejected with `422 Unprocessable Entity`.

**Optional: `Idempotency-Key` header**

For stricter retry-replay semantics you may additionally send an optional `Idempotency-Key` HTTP header. Whereas reusing an `issuer_request_id` is rejected with a `422`, a matching `Idempotency-Key` lets Alpaca replay the original response so an automated retry can proceed as if it were the first call:

```http
Idempotency-Key: <your-unique-key>
```

* When present, the value must be between 1 and 128 characters after trimming surrounding whitespace, and contain only printable ASCII characters (no spaces). A malformed key is rejected with `400 Bad Request`.
* If Alpaca has already processed a request with the same `Idempotency-Key` **and an identical body**, the original response is replayed instead of creating a new redeem request, and Alpaca sets the `Idempotent-Replayed: true` response header. A replay of a request that was originally `rejected` is returned with `400 Bad Request`.
* Reusing the same `Idempotency-Key` with a **different body** is rejected with `422 Unprocessable Entity`.

*Alpaca's Instant Tokenization Network is owned and developed by AlpacaDB, Inc. and Alpaca Crypto LLC. Additional geographic restrictions may apply for tokenization services based on local regulatory requirements. Neither Alpaca Crypto LLC nor Alpaca Securities LLC are the issuer of, nor directly involved in, the tokenization of any assets. Tokenization is performed by a third party. Tokenized assets do not represent direct equity ownership in any underlying company or issuer. Instead, tokenized assets generally provide economic exposure to the equity securities of an underlying issuer. As such, holders of tokenized assets have no voting rights, dividend entitlements, or legal claims to the underlying company shares or any residual assets in the event of the underlying company’s liquidation or insolvency, unless explicitly stated otherwise. All investments involve risk.
