# About Market Data API

Gain seamless access to a wealth of data with Alpaca Market Data API, offering real-time and historical information for equities, options, crypto and more.

# Overview

The Market Data API offers seamless access to market data through both HTTP and WebSocket protocols. With a focus on historical and real-time data, developers can efficiently integrate these APIs into their applications.

To simplify the integration process, we provide user-friendly SDKs in [Python](https://github.com/alpacahq/alpaca-py), [Go](https://github.com/alpacahq/alpaca-trade-api-go), [NodeJS](https://github.com/alpacahq/alpaca-trade-api-js), and [C#](https://github.com/alpacahq/alpaca-trade-api-csharp). These SDKs offer comprehensive functionalities, making it easier for developers to work with the Market Data APIs & Web Sockets.

To experiment with the APIs, developers can try them with [Postman](https://www.postman.com/): either through the [public workspace on Postman](https://www.postman.com/alpacamarkets) or directly from our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alpacahq/alpaca-postman).

By leveraging Alpaca Market Data API and its associated SDKs, developers can seamlessly incorporate historical and real-time market data into their applications, enabling them to build powerful and data-driven financial products.

# Subscription Plans

Alpaca offers two distinct subscription models depending on how you access our platform:

* **Trading API:** For individual traders using Alpaca's trading platform directly
* **Broker API:** For broker partners building their own trading platforms on top of Alpaca's infrastructure

  Which one applies to me?

  If you signed up for an Alpaca account to trade or build a personal trading app, you're using the Trading API. If you're a business integrating Alpaca as your backend brokerage provider, you're using the Broker API.
</Callout>

## Trading API Subscriptions

For individual traders and developers using Alpaca's Trading API, we offer two subscription plans: **Basic** and **Algo Trader Plus**.

The **Basic** plan serves as the default option for both Paper and Live trading accounts, ensuring all users can access essential data with zero cost. However, this plan only includes limited real-time data: for equities only the IEX exchange, for options only the indicative feed. For advanced traders we recommend subscribing to **Algo Trader Plus** which includes complete market coverage for stocks and options as well.

### Equities

Our data sources are directly fed by the CTA (Consolidated Tape Association), which is administered by NYSE (New York Stock Exchange), and the UTP (Unlisted Trading Privileges) stream, which is administered by Nasdaq. The synergy of these two sources ensures comprehensive market coverage, encompassing 100% of market volume.

### Options

Our options data sources are directly fed by OPRA (Options Price Reporting Authority).

## Broker API Subscriptions

For broker partners integrating Alpaca's Broker API, we offer tiered subscription plans designed for higher-volume, multi-user platforms.

For equities & options, the below subscription plans are available.

| Subscription Name | RPM (Request Per Minute) | Stream Connection Limit | Stream Symbol Limit | Equities Price (per month) | Options Indicative Feed (per month) |
| :---------------- | :----------------------- | :---------------------- | :------------------ | :------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| Standard          | 1,000                    | 5                       | unlimited           | included                   | additional $1,000                   |
| StandardPlus3000  | 3,000                    | 5                       | unlimited           | $500                       | additional $1,000                   |
| StandardPlus5000  | 5,000                    | 5                       | unlimited           | $1,000                     | included                            |
| StandardPlus10000 | 10,000                   | 10                      | unlimited           | $2,000                     | included                            |

Note: Standard subscription plans will only be active when integration starts. Prior to that, the account will be on the Basic plan listed above. Additionally, similar to the free plan all the standard plans are real time IEX or 15 mins delayed SIP.

For partners on the Standard and StandardPlus3000 plans, an additional subscription fee of $1,000 / month enables access to the same equities plan for options. For StandardPlus5000 and StandardPlus10000 plans, options are included.

# Authentication

With the exception of historical crypto data, all market data endpoints require authentication. Authentication differs between the Trading & Broker API. API keys can be acquired in the web UI (under the API keys on the right sidebar).

### Trading API

You should authenticate by passing the key / secret pair in the HTTP request headers named:

* `APCA-API-KEY-ID`
* `APCA-API-SECRET-KEY`

### Broker API

Broker API uses the [Client Credentials](https://docs.alpaca.markets/docs/authentication#client-credentials) authentication flow. You must first exchange your credentials for a short-lived access token, then use that token to authenticate API requests.

* Step 1: Request an access token

```curl
curl -X POST "https://authx.alpaca.markets/v1/oauth2/token" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
     -d "grant_type=client_credentials" \
     -d "client_id={YOUR_CLIENT_ID}" \
     -d "client_secret={YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET}"
```

* Step 2: Use the token to authenticate

```curl
curl -X GET "https://data.alpaca.markets/v2/..." \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer {TOKEN}"
```

  Note: Access tokens are valid for 15 minutes. Do not request a new token for each API call.

For the WebSocket stream authentication, kindly refer to the [WebSocket Stream documentation](https://docs.alpaca.markets/docs/streaming-market-data#authentication).
