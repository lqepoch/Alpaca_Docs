# US IPOs (Initial Public Offerings)

This guide provides a comprehensive reference for integrating U.S. IPOs into your platform.

## Overview of US IPOs

Alpaca offers access to a broad range of US IPO offerings, allowing partners to buy shares at the IPO listing, before the stock becomes available on the secondary market.

The IPO API provides:

* **Read-only discovery** of IPO offerings
* **Order placement and management** via the existing Broker API
* **Real-time offering updates** via Server-Sent Events (SSE)

#### Order Management

US IPOs only accept notional (dollar amount) GTC orders. End-users are able to place one conditional order to buy (COBs) per IPO offering, once it becomes available in the API. This order can be modified/canceled until the 60 minute window ends.

Fractional shares are not supported for IPOs.

#### Sample IPO Timeline

Below is an example of an IPO timeline. Please note that not all IPOs follow this timeline and they’re always subject to change.

| Step | Event                               | Description                                                                          | Date & Time (ET)              |

## Authentication

Authentication uses the same Alpaca OAuth 2.0 bearer token used for Broker API. No changes are required.

**Example header:**

```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

| Response Code      | Description                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Missing, invalid, or expired token   |
| `403 Forbidden`    | Valid token without sufficient scope |

| sixty\_minute\_expiration\_time | string (RFC3339) | **Optional.** When the 60-minute withdrawal window has started for this offering, this is the RFC3339 timestamp at which the window expires (e.g. `"2026-05-19T20:00:01Z"`). Absent on offerings whose 60-minute window has not started. **Note:** this field is only the *expiration* of the window — to know *when* the window opens, subscribe to the `SixtyMinMail` event on the IPO Events Stream. The field is intended to drive UI countdowns once you have been notified via SSE. |
| underwriters                    | array of strings | List of underwriter names participating in the offering.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Endpoints

### List IPO Offerings

`GET /v1/ipos`

Retrieves a paginated list of IPO offerings.

> **Note on the offerings:**
>
> Two offerings can share the same `ticker_symbol` but have a different `ipo_reference,availability`. This can happen if an issuer lists a deal then cancels or postpones it and enough time passes, where financials change, they make changes to prospectus, etc. In this case, the IPO reference will be different but the symbol will still be the same.

#### Parameters

| Parameter      | Type    | Description                | Notes                                  |
| -------------- | ------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `availability` | string  | IPO availability status    | `not_available`, `available`, `closed` |
| `ticker`       | string  | Filter by stock ticker     | e.g., `EXMP`, `ACME`                   |
| `limit`        | integer | Number of results per page | Default: 50, Max: 200                  |
| `page_token`   | string  | Token for pagination       | Used to fetch the next page            |

#### Example Request

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "https://broker-api.alpaca.markets/v1/ipos?availability=available&limit=50"
```

#### Example Response (200)

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "Example Corp",
      "description": "Example business description",
      "ticker_symbol": "EXMP",
      "ipo_reference": "EXMP260615",
      "cusip_id": "123456789",
      "prospectus_url": "https://example.com/prospectus.pdf",

      "max_ticket_size": "10000"
    }
  ],
  "next_page_token": null
}
```

> **Notes on the example:**
>
> * `unit_step_size` is omitted because this offering does not enforce a step-size constraint.
> * `sixty_minute_expiration_time` is absent because the 60-minute withdrawal window has not started yet.
> * Numeric fields (`min_price`, `max_price`, `min_ticket_size`, etc.) are decimal strings with no fixed precision — do not assume two-decimal formatting.
> * `ipo_reference` is opaque; do not parse or assume a specific shape.

## Placing IPO Orders

IPO orders are placed using the standard Broker API order endpoints. Order requests and responses use the **standard Order schema** — see the [Create Order for Account](https://docs.alpaca.markets/us/reference/createorderforaccount) reference for the complete request and response field set. The fields below are the IPO-specific points of attention.

<Callout icon="📘" theme="info">
  Omnibus & Omnisub partners will have to place multiple orders for the same offering. A new order will have to be placed for every end-user order on an IPO offering. No bulk orders/aggregation of orders will be supported.
</Callout>

### IPO-specific order rules

* Use the `ipo_reference` (offering reference) as the `symbol` field in order requests.
* IPO orders are **notional-only**: provide `notional`; omit `qty`. On responses, `qty` will always be `null` for IPO orders.
* Only `side=buy` is accepted for IPOs.
* `type` must be `market`.
* `time_in_force` must be `gtc` — effective only during the offering period and the 60-minute withdrawal window.
* Orders are validated against offering constraints (`min_ticket_size`, `max_ticket_size`, and `unit_step_size` when present).
* `asset_class` on responses is `"ipo"`.

### Place an IPO Order

`POST /v1/trading/accounts/{account_id}/orders`

New orders can only be placed while the offering is `availability=available` and **before** the 60-minute withdrawal window starts (`no_new_orders=false`). Orders submitted after the 60-minute window has started may be accepted synchronously and rejected later via the [trade events SSE stream](https://docs.alpaca.markets/us/reference/subscribetotradev2sse) — see [Error Handling](#error-handling) for details.

#### Example Request

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "https://broker-api.alpaca.markets/v1/trading/accounts/{account_id}/orders" \
  -d '{
    "symbol": "EXMP260615",
    "side": "buy",
    "type": "market",
    "time_in_force": "gtc",
    "notional": "1000",
    "client_order_id": "my-unique-order-123"
  }'
```

#### Example Response (200)

The response is a standard Order object. The IPO-specific fields to focus on:

```json
{
  "id": "b50c01d4-3d71-4295-8426-93c953c1ceb6",
  "client_order_id": "my-unique-order-123",
  "status": "new",
  "asset_class": "ipo",
  "symbol": "EXMP260615",
  "notional": "1000",
  "qty": null,
  "side": "buy",
  "type": "market",
  "time_in_force": "gtc",
  "created_at": "2026-06-09T15:30:00.000Z",
  "submitted_at": "2026-06-09T15:30:00.000Z"
}
```

The full response also includes the standard Order fields (`updated_at`, `filled_at`, `filled_qty`, `filled_avg_price`, `expired_at`, `canceled_at`, `failed_at`, `replaced_at`, `replaced_by`, `replaces`, `asset_id`, `order_class`, `order_type`, `position_intent`, `limit_price`, `stop_price`, `extended_hours`, `legs`, `trail_percent`, `trail_price`, `hwm`, `subtag`, `source`). See the [Create Order for Account](https://docs.alpaca.markets/us/reference/createorderforaccount) reference for the canonical schema.

### Replace an IPO Order

`PATCH /v1/trading/accounts/{account_id}/orders/{order_id}`

See the [Replace Order for Account](https://docs.alpaca.markets/us/reference/replaceorderforaccount) reference for the full schema. For IPO orders, only `notional` and `client_order_id` are meaningful in the request body. Modifications are accepted throughout the offering period and the 60-minute withdrawal window — once the withdrawal window ends, the COB becomes binding and modifications are no longer permitted.

#### Example Request

```bash
curl -s -X PATCH \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "https://broker-api.alpaca.markets/v1/trading/accounts/{account_id}/orders/{order_id}" \
  -d '{
    "notional": "1500"
  }'
```

#### Rejection after the modification window closes

Replace requests submitted after the modification window has closed are currently **accepted synchronously** (`HTTP 200`) and rejected later via the [trade events SSE stream](https://docs.alpaca.markets/us/reference/subscribetotradev2sse) — see [Asynchronous rejections](#asynchronous-rejections). The trade event arrives as a `rejected` event whose inner `order.reason` references the closed modification window. Subscribe to the trade events stream to surface this terminal status to end-users.

### Cancel an IPO Order

`DELETE /v1/trading/accounts/{account_id}/orders/{order_id}`

See the [Delete Order for Account](https://docs.alpaca.markets/us/reference/deleteorderforaccount) reference. Cancellation is accepted throughout the offering period and the 60-minute withdrawal window — once the withdrawal window ends, the COB becomes binding and cancellation is no longer permitted.

#### Example Request

```bash
curl -s -X DELETE \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "https://broker-api.alpaca.markets/v1/trading/accounts/{account_id}/orders/{order_id}"
```

### Get IPO Order

`GET /v1/trading/accounts/{account_id}/orders/{order_id}`

Retrieve the current status of an IPO order. Returns the standard Order schema — see [Get Order for Account](https://docs.alpaca.markets/us/reference/getorderforaccount).

#### Example Request

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "https://broker-api.alpaca.markets/v1/trading/accounts/{account_id}/orders/{order_id}"
```

#### Example Response (200)

  "submitted_at": "2026-06-09T15:30:00.000Z",
  "filled_at": null
}
```

### List IPO Orders

`GET /v1/trading/accounts/{account_id}/orders`

List orders for an account, optionally filtered by IPO symbol. Uses the standard [List Orders for Account](https://docs.alpaca.markets/us/reference/getallorders) endpoint and parameter set.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type    | Description                               |
| --------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `symbols` | string  | Filter by IPO symbol (`ipo_reference`)    |
| `status`  | string  | Filter by order status                    |
| `limit`   | integer | Number of results (default: 50, max: 500) |

#### Example Request

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "https://broker-api.alpaca.markets/v1/trading/accounts/{account_id}/orders?symbols=EXMP260615"
```

### Order Status Flow

IPO orders follow a specific lifecycle:

| Status        | Description                                                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pending_new` | Order submitted, awaiting acknowledgment (transient)        |
| `new`         | Order accepted, awaiting allocation                         |
| `filled`      | Shares allocated at final price                             |
| `canceled`    | Order canceled during withdrawal window                     |
| `rejected`    | Order rejected (constraints not met, offering closed, etc.) |
| `replaced`    | Order replaced                                              |

**Typical flow:**

1. Order placed → `pending_new` (briefly)
2. Acceptance → `new`
3. Allocation received → `filled` (with `filled_qty` and `filled_avg_price` populated)

**Note:** Available 24/7, so orders transition from `pending_new` to `new` immediately upon acceptance. Orders remain in `new` status until the offering closes and allocations are distributed. The `pending_new` status is transient and should resolve within seconds.

**Important:** The statuses `held`, `accepted`, `pending_cancel`, and `pending_replace` are not part of the standard IPO order lifecycle. If you observe these statuses persisting, it may indicate an issue.

### Asynchronous rejections

Some rejection conditions are **not** evaluated synchronously at submission time and are instead delivered later as a `rejected` event on the [trade events SSE stream](https://docs.alpaca.markets/us/reference/subscribetotradev2sse) (`GET /v2/events/trades`). The most common cases are:

* Submitting a new order against an offering that has entered its 60-minute withdrawal window (`no_new_orders=true`) — the order is accepted as `pending_new` and rejected asynchronously.
* Replacing or cancelling an order after the modification window has closed — the request is accepted synchronously and rejected asynchronously.
* Account-level eligibility checks that fail post-acceptance.
* Allocation-time rejections (e.g. duplicate orders, allocation engine constraints).

Always subscribe to the trade events stream alongside the IPO events stream to surface these terminal status changes to end-users.

***

## IPO Positions

Once an IPO is allocated to an end-user, it appears as a position on the standard positions endpoints with `asset_class: "us_equity"`. See the [Positions API reference](https://docs.alpaca.markets/us/reference/getallopenpositions) for the full schema.

### Lifecycle

There are three lifecycle states relevant to position visibility:

1. **Before allocation.** While the order is still in `new` / `pending_new`, no position row exists — there is no fill yet.
2. **Post-allocation, pre-secondary-listing.** Once the allocation is delivered, a position row appears with `qty`, `qty_available`, `avg_entry_price`, and `cost_basis` populated from the allocation. Market-data-derived fields are unavailable in this window because the security has not started trading on the secondary market yet — see [below](#market-data-fields-during-the-pre-listing-window).
3. **Once secondary trading starts.** The pricer feed for the security activates; market-data fields populate normally on subsequent reads.

### Market-data fields during the pre-listing window

While the position is in the **post-allocation, pre-secondary-listing** window, the following fields are returned as `null`:

* `market_value`
* `unrealized_pl`, `unrealized_plpc`
* `unrealized_intraday_pl`, `unrealized_intraday_plpc`
* `current_price`, `lastday_price`, `change_today`
* `exchange` is returned as an empty string

The fields populated in this window are:

* `asset_class: "ipo"`
* `symbol` (the `ipo_reference`)
* `qty`, `qty_available` (the allocated share count)
* `avg_entry_price`, `cost_basis` (derived from the final allocation price)
* `side`

**Recommendation:** when rendering an allocated-but-not-yet-listed IPO position, fall back to `avg_entry_price` for any UI cell that would normally show a current price, and treat unrealized P\&L as zero until secondary trading begins.

| --------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `since`   | string (date) | Optional. Replay historical events from this date forward (`YYYY-MM-DD`). When omitted, the stream only delivers new events from the moment of connection. Use this for reconnect / replay. |

### Event Types

| Event                  | Description                         | Visibility  |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `Offering`             | New IPO offering created            | Broadcast   |
| `OfferingUpdate`       | Offering details changed            | Broadcast   |

| `event_id`           | string (ULID)    | ULID identifying this event uniquely. Useful for de-duplication when reconnecting with `since=`. |
| `payload`            | object \| absent | Event-specific data. **Optional** — `OfferingCancellation` events do not include a `payload`.    |
| `at`                 | string (RFC3339) | Source timestamp from the upstream IPO system.                                                   |
| `received_at`        | string (RFC3339) | Timestamp when Alpaca received and broadcast the event. Typically very close to `at`.            |

### Allocation Events

Allocation events include additional account-specific fields at the top level (alongside the envelope):

```json
{
  "verb": "Allocation",
  "offering_reference": "EXMP260615",
  "event_id": "01JBPXJ4Z8XWQK3QY2Q5N9R8KT",
  "account_number": "511768662",
  "correspondent": "LPCA",
  "payload": {
    "cusip_id": "123456789",
    "final_price": "20",
    "allocated_shares": "100",
    "allocated_amount": "2000",
    "subject": "IPO Allocation: Example Corp"
  },
  "at": "2026-06-12T07:30:00.000Z",
  "received_at": "2026-06-12T07:30:00.000Z"
}
```

| Field            | Type   | Description                              |
| ---------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `account_number` | string | Alpaca account number                    |
| `correspondent`  | string | Broker correspondent code (e.g., `LPCA`) |

### Example Request

```bash
# Live tail
curl -N \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "https://broker-api.alpaca.markets/v2/events/ipos"

# Replay events from a given date forward
curl -N \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "https://broker-api.alpaca.markets/v2/events/ipos?since=2026-06-01"
```

### Example Event Payloads

**Offering created:**

```http
data: {"verb":"Offering","offering_reference":"EXMP260615","event_id":"01JBPXJ4Z8XWQK3QY2Q5N9R8KT","payload":{"name":"Example Corp","ticker_symbol":"EXMP","offering_type_name":"IPO","available_to_order":"Available","min_price":"18","max_price":"22","source":"sync-offerings"},"at":"2026-06-09T10:30:00.000Z","received_at":"2026-06-09T10:30:00.000Z"}
```

> **`payload.available_to_order`** is emitted as a PascalCase enum string — one of `"Available"`, `"NotAvailable"`, or `"Closed"`. Note this is **not** the same value space as the offering object's `availability` field, which is lowercase (`available` / `not_available` / `closed`). When mapping between the two, normalize on the client side. **`payload.source`** identifies the upstream sync source (e.g. `"sync-offerings"`). Treat as informational.

**Sixty-Minute Mail:**

```http
data: {"verb":"SixtyMinMail","offering_reference":"EXMP260615","event_id":"01JBPXJ4Z8XWQK3QY2Q5N9R8KT","payload":{"subject":"60-minute withdrawal window: Example Corp","sixty_minute_expiration_time":"2026-06-15 13:00:02 UTC"},"at":"2026-06-15T12:00:02.000Z","received_at":"2026-06-15T12:00:02.000Z"}
```

> **`payload.sixty_minute_expiration_time`** is a free-form string in the form `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC` — **not** RFC3339, and **not** the same format as the `sixty_minute_expiration_time` attribute on the offering object (which is RFC3339). Parse against the explicit `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC` layout when reading from the SSE payload.

**Offering cancellation:**

```http
data: {"verb":"OfferingCancellation","offering_reference":"EXMP260615","event_id":"01JBPXJ4Z8XWQK3QY2Q5N9R8KT","at":"2026-06-09T11:00:00.000Z","received_at":"2026-06-09T11:00:00.000Z"}
```

> `OfferingCancellation` events do not include a `payload`. Treat the absence as an empty body.

**Allocation:**

```http
data: {"verb":"Allocation","offering_reference":"EXMP260615","event_id":"01JBPXJ4Z8XWQK3QY2Q5N9R8KT","account_number":"511768662","correspondent":"LPCA","payload":{"final_price":"20","allocated_shares":"100","allocated_amount":"2000"},"at":"2026-06-12T07:30:00.000Z","received_at":"2026-06-12T07:30:00.000Z"}
```

### Response Headers

| Header              | Value               | Description                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `Content-Type`      | `text/event-stream` |                                                    |
| `Cache-Control`     | `no-cache`          |                                                    |
| `Connection`        | `keep-alive`        |                                                    |
| `X-Ratelimit-Limit` | `20`                | Maximum concurrent SSE consumers per access token. |

### Notes

* **Reconnect** on connection drops: re-issue the request with `since=<last-received-date>` to replay events you may have missed during the disconnect, then de-duplicate using `event_id`.
* **Browser note**: Native `EventSource` does not support setting headers; use a polyfill or fetch-based SSE shim that allows passing the `Authorization` header.

### The `SixtyMinMail` Event

This event signals the start of the 60-minute COB (Conditional Order to Buy) withdrawal/cancellation final window on the effective date:

* Investors can cancel or modify orders during this window.
* New orders cannot be placed after the 60-minute window has started.
* After the window ends, the COB becomes binding.
* Consider sending an additional email notification to the end-user for auditability.

> **Driving a UI countdown:** the offering object exposes `sixty_minute_expiration_time` (RFC3339) once the window has started — use the `SixtyMinMail` SSE event as the *trigger* to enter the countdown UI, then read the offering's `sixty_minute_expiration_time` (or the SSE payload's `sixty_minute_expiration_time`) for the deadline. The expiration field on the offering object alone cannot be used as a start signal because by the time it appears, the window has already begun.

***

## Pagination

* Use `limit` and `page_token` on list endpoints
* On 200 responses, `next_page_token` is returned if more results are available
* Pass `next_page_token` as `page_token` in subsequent requests

***

## Error Handling

### Where errors come from

1. **API response (synchronous)** — The server returns an HTTP error status and a JSON body with `code` and `message`.
2. **Trade events (SSE, asynchronous)** — After an order is accepted, it may later be rejected. That rejection is delivered on the account's [trade events stream](https://docs.alpaca.markets/us/reference/subscribetotradev2sse) (`GET /v2/events/trades`) — see [Asynchronous rejections](#asynchronous-rejections) above.

### REST API

On error the API returns:

* **HTTP status:** 400, 401, 403, 404, 422, 429, 500, 501, 503, 504
* **JSON body:** `code` (number), `message` (string)

Example:

```json
{ "code": 40020012, "message": "IPO orders must specify notional and omit qty" }
```

### General error codes (all APIs, including IPO)

The same error codes and HTTP statuses that apply to all Alpaca API endpoints also apply to IPO endpoints. See the main API documentation for the full list.

### IPO-specific error codes

IPO order create and replace can return the following. HTTP status varies (400, 404, 422, 500, 501, 429, 503, 504).

| **HTTP Status Code** | **Error Code** | **Error Message**                                              |

#### Notes on common cases

* **Submitting against a closed offering** returns `422 / 40010001 / "asset <symbol> is not active"`. (`availability=closed` rejections are surfaced through the standard inactive-asset code, not through `42210000`.)
* **Submitting with a non-numeric or malformed `notional`** returns `400 / 40010000 / "request body format is invalid"` at the request-validation layer, before IPO-specific checks run.
* **Submitting against an offering inside its 60-minute withdrawal window** (`no_new_orders=true`) is **accepted synchronously** as `pending_new` and rejected later via the trade events SSE stream — see [Asynchronous rejections](#asynchronous-rejections).
* **Replacing or cancelling an order after the modification window has closed** is also **accepted synchronously** and rejected later via the trade events SSE stream. There is no synchronous `40320060` / "modification window closed" error today.

### Trade events (SSE)

Rejections after order acceptance are delivered on the [trade events SSE stream](https://docs.alpaca.markets/us/reference/subscribetotradev2sse) (`GET /v2/events/trades`). Each rejection arrives as a `rejected` event whose inner `order` object carries the standard order fields plus a `reason` string when one is available. Common IPO rejection reasons include offering closed, account eligibility, duplicate orders, and allocation engine outcomes — these reasons are free-text and may vary.

For the full event envelope, schema, and reconnection semantics, see the [Subscribe to Trade Events (SSE)](https://docs.alpaca.markets/us/reference/subscribetotradev2sse) reference. The same `since` / `since_id` replay parameters documented there apply.

## Integration Checklist

1. Ensure your OAuth token has the required scopes.
2. Implement `GET /v1/ipos` to discover available offerings; treat `ipo_reference` as opaque.
3. Use the `ipo_reference` as the `symbol` when placing orders.
4. Use notional-only orders (provide `notional`, omit `qty`); `side=buy`, `type=market`, `time_in_force=gtc`.
5. Validate orders against `min_ticket_size`, `max_ticket_size`, and `unit_step_size` when present (note `unit_step_size` is optional and may be absent).
6. Handle the 60-minute withdrawal window: stop allowing new orders once `no_new_orders=true`, and surface a countdown using `sixty_minute_expiration_time` once the `SixtyMinMail` SSE event fires.
7. Subscribe to the IPO events SSE stream (`GET /v2/events/ipos`) for offering lifecycle events. Use PascalCase verbs when filtering.
8. Subscribe to the trade events SSE stream (`GET /v2/events/trades`) for asynchronous order rejections (e.g. orders submitted during the 60-minute window).
9. Implement reconnection logic using `since=<date>` for replay, and de-duplicate by `event_id` (ULID).
10. Handle pre-listing IPO positions: market-data fields are `null` between allocation and the first secondary-market trade; render UI cells from `avg_entry_price` until prices populate.
