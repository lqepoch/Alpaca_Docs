## How Fees are charged and reflected in account balances

1. Alpaca's trading system keeps track of the accrued FEE amounts intraday and deducts the pending amounts from account balances.
2. At EOD, we charge each account the fees for that trading day
3. We round up total fees based on the currency’s precision to the nearest decimal place.
   For example, USD has a precision of 0.01. If the total fee is calculated as 0.00083, it will be rounded up to 0.01 (i.e., 1 penny).
