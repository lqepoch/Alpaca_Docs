# 24/5 Trading

### What is 24/5 Trading (Overnight Trading)?

Overnight Trading extends market hours to provide a 24-hour, 5-day-a-week trading experience for all NMS securities. The overnight session operates from 8:00 PM ET Sunday to 4:00 AM ET Friday, bridging the gap between one day's post-market session and the next day's pre-market session.

***

### How does the overnight trading session work?

Overnight trade executions and market data are facilitated by the Blue Ocean Alternative Trading System (BOATS). As an Alternative Trading System (ATS), BOATS operates an independent overnight trading session outside of traditional stock exchanges.

***

### What are the hours for the 24/5 trading sessions?

The trading sessions are structured as follows, from Sunday evening to Friday evening:

* **Overnight Session:** 8:00 PM - 4:00 AM ET (technically occurs on the evening before the trade date)
* **Pre-Market Session:** 4:00 AM – 9:30 AM ET
* **Regular Market Session:** 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET
* **After-Hours Session:** 4:00 PM - 8:00 PM ET

The overnight session follows the NYSE holiday calendar. If US markets are fully closed for a holiday, the overnight trading session immediately preceding that holiday will not run. ***For example, the overnight session will be closed on the Wednesday evening before US Thanksgiving (8:00 PM ET) and will resume on Thursday evening at 8:00 PM ET.*** On US market half-days, the overnight trading session runs as normal for the full eight hours (8:00 PM ET – 4:00 AM ET), even if regular or after-hours trading closes early. ***For example, on the Friday after US Thanksgiving, the overnight session runs as usual, but the after-hours session does not.***

***

### How can I enable overnight trading?

Please contact your Customer Success Manager for details on pricing and the steps required to enable overnight trading for your account.

***

### How can I access market data for the overnight session?

We offer a high-accuracy indicative data feed through our partnership with Blue Ocean, available for a monthly fee. Please contact our sales team for pricing details.

***

### What is included in the overnight market data feed?

The market data feed provides access to:

* **Indicative Real-time Quotes:** Real-time bid and ask prices that are indicative of the market.
* **Indicative Trades:** Trade data that is delayed by 15 minutes and adjusted to fit within the real-time bid-ask spread.

***

### What securities are available for overnight trading?

All National Market System (NMS) securities are available for trading during the overnight session. Assets tradable in the overnight session can be identified via the `overnight_tradable` attribute in the Assets API.  The list may be limited due to compliance or risk procedures, and the best way to validate the available securities is by using our Assets API as outlined above. OTC securities are not part of the NMS and are therefore not available.

***

### What order types and time-in-force (TIF) options are supported?

* **Order Type:** Only `limit` orders are supported during the overnight session.
* **Time-in-Force (TIF):** The supported TIF options are `day` and `gtc`.
  * **`day`:** Orders placed during the overnight session will remain active through the regular and after-hours sessions of the upcoming trading day. If unfilled, the order is canceled at 8:00 PM ET.
  * **`gtc`:** Good-Til-Canceled orders remain active across trading sessions until they are either filled or explicitly canceled. The table below summarizes the supported `gtc` configurations and their default corporate action handling.

| Order Type     | `extended_hours` / Overnight | TIF   | Default Corporate Action Handling |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ----- | --------------------------------- |
| Fractional     | `true`                       | `gtc` | Cancelled at 8 PM ET              |
| Fractional     | `false`                      | `gtc` | Not supported                     |
| Non-Fractional | `true`                       | `gtc` | Cancelled at 8 PM ET              |
| Non-Fractional | `false`                      | `gtc` | Cancelled at 8 PM ET              |

In order to get GTC support, please reach out to your Customer Success Manager to enable it.

> 📘 **Note**
>
> Fractional `gtc` orders without `extended_hours` / overnight enabled are not currently supported.

***

### Is fractional share trading supported?

Yes, fractional share trading is supported during the overnight session and functions the same way as it does during other extended-hours sessions.

***

### Are there restrictions on margin or buying power during the overnight session?

Yes. Day Trading Buying Power (DTBP) does not apply to the overnight session. This means 2x multiplier is the max margin buying power for overnight session trades. If an account uses DTBP for an order during the post market session, the order might be rejected (at 8 PM ET) due to insufficient buying power (if reg\_t or non-DT buying power is insufficient).

***

### What happens to an order that is not filled during the overnight session?

If your `day` order is not filled during the overnight session, it will automatically carry over into the pre-market, regular, and after-hours sessions for that trade date. It remains an active order until it is executed or the market closes at 8:00 PM ET.

***

### How does trade settlement work for overnight trades?

The overnight session marks the beginning of a new trading day. Trades are assigned a date based on their execution time and settle on a T+1 basis from that date.

* **Example:** A trade executed at 9:00 PM ET on a Monday is assigned a trade date of Tuesday and will settle on Wednesday (T+1).

***

### How do corporate actions affect overnight trading?

A security may be halted from trading during the overnight session while a pending corporate action is being processed. Furthermore, due to the way trade dates are assigned, purchasing a stock during the overnight session on its ex-dividend date will not entitle you to that stock's dividend.

***

### What happens when a security is halted during the overnight session?

If an asset is halted overnight (e.g., due to a corporate action or pending news), the halt typically persists for the entire session. Orders submitted for a halted security will be accepted by the system with a status of `accepted` but will be held in a pending state. This ensures your order can be executed as soon as the halt is lifted and trading resumes in the next session.

***

### What API changes are required to support overnight trading?

Integration requires awareness of two new boolean attributes in the `Assets` API endpoint:

* `overnight_tradable`: Indicates if the asset is eligible for trading in the overnight session.
* `overnight_halted`: Indicates if an `overnight_tradable` asset is currently halted.

Additionally, a new `overnight` feed name has been introduced for the Market Data API.

***

### How can I identify which assets are tradable overnight via the API?

You can identify eligible assets by calling the `v1/assets` endpoint and filtering for assets where the `overnight_tradable` attribute is `true`.

***

### When is the best time to sync the list of overnight-tradable assets?

We begin syncing our list of tradable assets at 7:05 PM ET and run updates every 10 minutes until 7:45 PM ET. For the most up-to-date list, we recommend syncing your asset list between 7:45 PM and 8:00 PM ET, with 7:55 PM ET being the ideal time.

***

<br />

### Can I access delayed historical overnight requests with an overnight subscription?

Yes, you can access delayed historical overnight requests with an overnight subscription, provided that the end parameter in your request is at least 15 minutes old.

**To access delayed historical overnight data, make sure to include the parameter `feed=boats` in your request, `feed=overnight` will give error.**

Example: If you have an overnight subscription and want to request overnight/BOATS data ending at 10:00 PM EST , you can do so any time after 10:15 PM by specifying`feed=boats` in your request.
