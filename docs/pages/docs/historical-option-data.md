# Data sources

Similarly to stocks, Alpaca offers two different data sources for options:

| Source                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| **Indicative**                               | Indicative Pricing Feed is a free derivative of the original OPRA feed: the quotes are not actual OPRA quotes, they’re just indicative derivatives. The trades are also derivatives and they’re delayed by 15 minutes.                                                                                    |
| **OPRA (Options Price Reporting Authority)** | OPRA is the consolidated BBO feed of OPRA. [OPRA Plan](https://www.opraplan.com/document-library) defines the BBO as the highest bid and lowest offer for a series of options available in one or more of the options markets maintained by the parties. OPRA feed is only available to subscribed users. |
