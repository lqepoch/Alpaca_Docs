# Alpaca-py (Python SDK)

[**Alpaca-py**](https://alpaca.markets/sdks/python/getting_started.html) provides an interface for interacting with the API products Alpaca offers. These API products are provided as various REST, WebSocket and SSE endpoints that allow you to do everything from streaming market data to creating your own trading apps. Here are some things you can do with Alpaca-py:

* [**Market Data API**](https://alpaca.markets/sdks/python/api_reference/data_api.html): Access live and historical market data for 5000+ stocks and 20+ crypto.
* [**Trading API**](https://alpaca.markets/sdks/python/api_reference/trading_api.html): Trade stock and crypto with lightning fast execution speeds.
* [**Broker API & Connect**](https://alpaca.markets/sdks/python/api_reference/broker_api.html): Build investment apps - from robo-advisors to brokerages.

# Alpaca-Java (Java SDK)

[**Alpaca-Java**](https://alpacahq.github.io/alpaca-java/) provides Java clients for Alpaca's Trading, Market Data, Broker, WebSocket, and Broker Events SSE APIs. Use it when you want to build trading applications, read historical or live market data, or build broker-backed investing experiences from a Java application.

The SDK includes a top-level AlpacaClient facade for common workflows, factory methods for pre-configured generated REST clients, and handwritten streaming clients for live data.

# Community-Made SDKs

In addition to the SDKs directly supported by Alpaca, individual members of our community have created and contributed their own wrappers for these other languages. We are providing these links as a courtesy to the community and to our users who are looking for the API wrapper in other languages or variants. Please be sure to carefully review any code you use to access our financial trading API and/or trust your account credentials to.
