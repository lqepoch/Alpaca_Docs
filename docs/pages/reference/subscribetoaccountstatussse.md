# Subscribe to Account Status Events (SSE)

The accounts events API provides streaming of account changes as they occur, via SSE (server sent events). Past events can also be queried.

Events are generated for changes to the following account properties:
- account_blocked
- admin_configurations
- cash_interest
- crypto_status
- kyc_results
- options
- status
- trading_blocked

Only the changed properties are included in the event payload.

Query Parameter Rules:
- `since_id` and `until_id` are deprecated and available only to select broker partners; use `since_ulid` and `until_ulid` instead
- `since` is required if `until` specified
- `since_id` is required if `until_id` specified
- `since_ulid` is required if `until_ulid` specified
- `since`, `since_id` and `since_ulid` can't be used at the same time

Behavior:
This API supports querying a range of events, starting now or in the past. If the end of the range is in the future or not specified, the connection is kept open and future events are pushed.

To be specific:
- if `since`, `since_id` or `since_ulid` is not specified, this will not return any historic data
- if `until`, `until_id` or `until_ulid` is reached, the stream will end with a status of 200

---

Note for people using the clients generated from this OAS spec. Currently OAS-3 doesn't have full support for representing SSE style responses from an API, so if you are using a generated client and don't specify a `since` and `until` there is a good chance the generated clients will hang waiting for the response to end.

If you require the streaming capabilities we recommend not using the generated clients for this specific usecase until the OAS-3 standards come to a consensus on how to represent this correctly in OAS-3.

For example changing the max_margin_multiplier from 4 to 1 will yield this payload:\n\n```\n{\n  \"max_margin_multiplier\": {\n    \"from\": 4,\n    \"to\": 1\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIntroducing an override value from the default will yield a null value as `from`. For example restricting the max_margin_multiplier to 1 from default will yield the following payload:\n\n```\n{\n  \"max_margin_multiplier\": {\n    \"from\": null,\n    \"to\": 1\n  }\n}\n```",

        "description": "The accounts events API provides streaming of account changes as they occur, via SSE (server sent events). Past events can also be queried.\n\nEvents are generated for changes to the following account properties:\n- account_blocked\n- admin_configurations\n- cash_interest\n- crypto_status\n- kyc_results\n- options\n- status\n- trading_blocked\n\nOnly the changed properties are included in the event payload.\n\nQuery Parameter Rules:\n- `since_id` and `until_id` are deprecated and available only to select broker partners; use `since_ulid` and `until_ulid` instead\n- `since` is required if `until` specified\n- `since_id` is required if `until_id` specified\n- `since_ulid` is required if `until_ulid` specified\n- `since`, `since_id` and `since_ulid` can't be used at the same time\n\nBehavior:\nThis API supports querying a range of events, starting now or in the past. If the end of the range is in the future or not specified, the connection is kept open and future events are pushed.\n\nTo be specific:\n- if `since`, `since_id` or `since_ulid` is not specified, this will not return any historic data\n- if `until`, `until_id` or `until_ulid` is reached, the stream will end with a status of 200\n\n---\n\nNote for people using the clients generated from this OAS spec. Currently OAS-3 doesn't have full support for representing SSE style responses from an API, so if you are using a generated client and don't specify a `since` and `until` there is a good chance the generated clients will hang waiting for the response to end.\n\nIf you require the streaming capabilities we recommend not using the generated clients for this specific usecase until the OAS-3 standards come to a consensus on how to represent this correctly in OAS-3.\n",
