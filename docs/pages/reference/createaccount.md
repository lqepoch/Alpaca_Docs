# Create an Account

Create an account for a new or existing account holder. Required fields, eligibility, and initial status depend on the account type, enabled assets, and your correspondent configuration. Account status changes are available through the Account Status Events stream.

To create an account for an existing holder, provide `primary_account_holder_id` instead of inline holder information. Among the documented account types, existing holders are supported for trading and IRA accounts. Donor-advised accounts instead reference an existing legal entity with `entity_id`.
