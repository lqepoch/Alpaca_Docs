# Request a New Transfer

Create a new transfer to deposit money into or withdraw money from an account.

Two `transfer_type` values are accepted, and both are available in sandbox and production:

- **`ach`** — supports both `INCOMING` (deposit) and `OUTGOING` (withdrawal) directions. A `relationship_id` from a previously created [ACH Relationship](https://docs.alpaca.markets/reference/createachrelationshipforaccount) is required.
- **`wire`** — supports the `OUTGOING` (withdrawal) direction only. Incoming wires cannot be initiated through this endpoint; they are pushed in by the sending bank and recorded automatically. A `bank_id` from a previously created [Bank Relationship](https://docs.alpaca.markets/reference/createrecipientbank) is required, and the bank must be in `APPROVED` status before the transfer will progress past `QUEUED`.

In the sandbox environment, ACH deposits and withdrawals settle instantly against virtual funds. Outgoing wire withdrawals are accepted and simulated end-to-end — no funds are transmitted to a bank, but the transfer progresses to `COMPLETE` and the account is debited against virtual funds. Sandbox wire withdrawals are asynchronous (not instant) and auto-complete on weekdays only; transfers submitted on a weekend will not progress until Monday. For more on funding accounts in sandbox, see [this tutorial](https://alpaca.markets/learn/fund-broker-api/).

Common reasons include:\n\n- `cannot submit incoming wire transfer using this API` — sent `transfer_type: wire` with `direction: INCOMING`. Incoming wires cannot be initiated through this endpoint.\n- `invalid relationship_id` / `bank_id required for wire transfer` — missing the required relationship/bank identifier for the chosen `transfer_type`.\n- `bank_id should be empty for ach transfer` / `relationship_id should be empty for wire transfer` — provided the wrong identifier for the chosen `transfer_type`.\n- `only wire transfer type can provide additional information for the transfer` — `additional_information` was supplied on a non-wire request.\n- `amount must be greater than 0.00` / `deposit amount must be greater than or equal to <min>` / `withdrawal amount must be greater than <min>` — amount fails the minimum-amount checks.\n- `transfer_type must be either ach or wire` / `direction must be either incoming or outgoing` — invalid enum values.\n"
