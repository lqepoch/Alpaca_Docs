# Create a Reverse Batch Journal Transaction (Many-to-One)

You can also create a batch journal request by using the following endpoint. This is enabled on JNLC for now only.

Note that if there is an invalid account_id the whole batch operation will be canceled.
Every single request must be valid for the entire batch operation to succeed.

A successful response contains an array of JNLC journal objects. If any account or entry is invalid, the whole batch operation is canceled and no per-item error result is returned.
